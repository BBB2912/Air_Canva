AirCanvas - Gesture-Based Drawing Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am excited to share my latest project, AirCanvas, an innovative gesture-based drawing tool that allows users to create digital art using simple hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to track hand movements and translates them into digital strokes, making the experience of drawing more interactive and intuitive.

In AirCanvas, users can switch between freemode and various shapes, choose different colors, and control the drawing process with specific gestures. For instance, pointing the middle finger down initiates the drawing, while lifting it up stops the action. Additionally, when drawing shapes, the user starts by initializing the origin point, continues to draw, and then lifts the middle finger to complete the shape. This allows for precise control over the drawing process, making it a versatile tool for creative expression.

Key Points and Metrics:

# Gesture Control: 
Drawing starts with the middle finger down and stops when lifted, providing seamless control over the drawing process.

# Freemode and Shapes: 
Users can switch between free drawing and predefined shapes, enabling a wide range of creative possibilities.

# Color Selection: 
A variety of colors are available, allowing for vibrant and personalized artwork.
Origin Initialization for Shapes: Shapes are drawn by setting an initial point and continuing the gesture, offering precision in design.

# Real-Time Feedback: 
The system provides immediate visual feedback, ensuring a smooth and responsive drawing experience.
Technology Stack: The project is built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, showcasing expertise in computer vision and real-time gesture recognition.
